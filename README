moon-buggy - drive a strage car across the moon

moon-buggy is a simple, curses-based game, where you drive some kinf
of car across the surface of the moon.  Unfortunately there are
dangerous craters there.  Fortunately your car can jump!  So just go
on, and jump over the craters (using the SPACE key).

Generic installation instructions are in the file INSTALL.  You can
choose the score file location via configure's `--sharedstatedir'
option.  On Linux systems you should use
	--sharedstatedir=/var/lib/games
to comply with the Linux file system standard.
