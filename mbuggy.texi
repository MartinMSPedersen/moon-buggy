@chapter Introduction

Moon-buggy is a simple, curses-based game, where you drive some kind
of car across the surface of the moon.  Unfortunately there are
dangerous craters there.  Fortunately your car can jump!

Moon-buggy is free software.  Read the file COPYING of the source code
distribution for details.

Please mail any suggestions and bug reports to
@email{voss@@mathematik.uni-kl.de}.  Your message should include the
moon-buggy version number, as obtained by the command @samp{moon-buggy -V}.

@chapter Invocation

Just start it.  Use the @key{SPC} bar to jump.

@chapter Installation

Moon-buggy requires the curses library as a prerequisite.  If curses is
not installed on your system, you may obtain the ncurses package
(@pxref{References}).

When you unpack the moon-buggy distribution, you get one directory, which
holds all the source files and the documentation.  If you have built
moon-buggy in this directory before, you can use the command @samp{make
distclean} to remove any files, which were created during the last
build.

The file @file{INSTALL} contains generic installation instructions,
which you can follow.  But in most cases you just type

@example
configure
make
make install
@end example

You can choose the score file location via configure's
@samp{--sharedstatedir} option.  On Linux you should use

@example
--sharedstatedir=/var/games
@end example

@noindent
to comply with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (@pxref{References}).
