@chapter Introduction

Moon-buggy is a simple, curses-based game, where you drive some kinf
of car across the surface of the moon.  Unfortunately there are
dangerous craters there.  Fortunately your car can jump!

Moon-buggy is free software.  Read the file COPYING of the source code
distribution for details.


@node Invocation, Installation, Introduction, Top
@chapter Invocation

Just start it.  Use the @key{space} bar to jump.


@node Installation,  , Invocation, Top
@chapter Installation

When you unpack the moon-buggy distribution, you get one directory, which
holds all the source files and the documentation.  If you have built
moon-buggy in this directory before, you can use the command @samp{make
distclean} to remove any files, which were created during the last
build.

The file @file{INSTALL} contains generic installation instructions,
which you can follow.  But in most cases you just type

@example
configure
make
make install
@end example

@contents
@bye
