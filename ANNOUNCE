	Announcement for Moon-buggy version 0.4
	=======================================

I'm proud to announce the release of Moon-buggy, version 0.4.

Moon-buggy is a simple character graphics game, where you drive some
kind of car across the moon's surface.  Unfortunately there are
dangerous craters there.  Fortunately your car can jump over them!

As the program's version number indicates, the program is not yet
finished.  Nevertheless the code, which is already there, seems stable
and the game is playable, now.

The program is supposed to compile and run on any POSIX compliant
system which provides the curses library.  But at the moment it is
only tested on GNU/Linux systems.

You may get moon-buggy via ftp from "sunsite.unc.edu".  It is in the
file "/pub/Linux/games/arcade/mbuggy-0.4.tar.gz".
