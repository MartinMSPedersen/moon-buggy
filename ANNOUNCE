	Announcement for Moon-buggy version 0.4
	=======================================

Moon-buggy is a simple character graphics game, where you drive some
kind of car across the moon's surface.  Unfortunately there are
dangerous craters there.  Fortunately your car can jump over them!

Version 0.4 of Moon-buggy is out!  As the version number indicates, the
program is not yet finished.  Nevertheless the code, which is already
there, seems stable and the game is playable, now.

The program is supposed to compile and run on any POSIX compliant
system which has the curses library installed.  But at the moment it is
only tested on GNU/Linux systems.

You may get moon-buggy from "sunsite.unc.edu".  It is in the file
"/pub/Linux/games/arcade/mbuggy-0.4.tar.gz".
